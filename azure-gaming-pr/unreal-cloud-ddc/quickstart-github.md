# Quickstart: Set up Unreal Cloud DDC by using GitHub

[!INCLUDE [preview](./includes/preview.md)]

This quickstart describes how to create and manage an Unreal Cloud DDC from a [GitHub Template Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unreal-cloud-ddc-on-azure), using infrastructure as code (IaC) design principals.

This solution is useful for managing multiple Unreal Cloud DDC deployments, which may be helpful for testing or supporting multiple projects.

The repository provides a preconfigured CI/CD experience for managing your Unreal Cloud DDC deployments. Use this template as a base to easily manage multiple deployments.

## Walkthrough

In this section, you'll deploy an Unreal Cloud DDC solution to Azure using GitHub. You'll also learn how to view and delete the solution.


### Create and configure with basic options

* Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unreal-cloud-ddc-on-azure) and select **Use this Template** -> **Create a new repository**.

![Use the GitHub template](media/use-this-template.png)

* Select either your organization or your alias as the **Owner** and provide a **Repository name**. It is recommended the repository be set to **Internal** or **Private**.

* For the newly created repository, create a new Service Principal for the GitHub Actions automation following the steps [here](https://github.com/Azure/login#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret). The Service Principal will require Contributor and [Role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) Granter or Owner access to the resource group. This is done once for the repository.

```azurecli-interactive
    az ad sp create-for-rbac \
        --name "unreal-cloud-ddc-github" \
        --role owner \
        --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id} \
        --sdk-auth
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must been using an Enterprise or Public Github Repo to use Environments. If you are using a personal private repo, you will need to customize the deployment workflows instead using uniquely named repository secrets for each deployment.

* Go to **Settings** (settings icon) > **Environments** > **Create a new environment** for the Studio's GitHub account that you're using for this new repo.
Enter a new name for the environment. For example, "my-unreal-ddc-env". Remember the name used here as you'll be using it again later. You must have admin access to configure environments.
  - Under **Environment secrets**, select **Add secret**. Enter **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** as the secret name and the JSON output of the previous step as the value.
  - To add another secret, repeat the steps above. Enter **APP_SECRET** as the secret name and the secret from Worker SP you previously [created](quickstart-first-setup-id.md#create-a-worker-identity) as the value.
* Go to the configs folder and create a new folder within it. The folder name here must match the GitHub environment name that you created earlier. If you've used the example above, the folder name here needs to be "my-unreal-ddc-env".
  - In the new folder (For example, configs > my-unreal-ddc-env), add a new JSON file called **parameters.json**. Customize this JSON file according to your needs.

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "location": {
            "value": "southcentralus"
        },
        "resourceGroupName": {
            "value": "studio-unreal-cloud-ddc",
        },,
        "servicePrincipalClientID": {
            "value": "<application-sp-id>"
        },
        "workerServicePrincipalClientID": {
            "value": "<worker-sp-id>"
        },
        "hostname":{
            "value": "<my-studio-hostname>"
        },
        "secondaryLocations": {
            "value": [
                "westus"
            ]
        },
        "epicEULA": {
            "value": true
        }
    }
}
```

Using **configs/my-unreal-ddc-env/parameters.json** as an example. Open the file and update the following parameters.

1. Set your **location**
1. Replace **servicePrincipalClientID** using the App ID created in the previous [step](quickstart-first-setup-id.md#create-an-application-identity).
1. Replace **workerServicePrincipalClientID** using the App Object ID created in the previous [step](quickstart-first-setup-id.md#create-a-worker-identity).
1. Add the **hostname** which will be used as the endpoint to connect to Unreal Cloud DDC.
1. List **secondaryLocations**, as additional regions to mirror the deployment.
1. Set **epicEULA** to **True** to acknowledge that you're accepting the [UnrealÂ® Engine End User License Agreement](https://www.unrealengine.com/eula/content).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must set the `epicEULA` value to **TRUE** in this file to acknowledge that you have accepted the [Epic EULA](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/content).

After the parameters file has been committed, a GitHub action will automatically deploy the application into your Azure Subscription.

### View the Unreal Cloud DDC deployment

* Go to the Azure portal menu or the home page and select **Managed Applications**.

    ![View managed applications](media/view-managed-applications.png)

* In the filter box, enter the deployment name and select it.

    ![Filter managed apps](media/filter-managed-apps.png)

### Delete the Unreal Cloud DDC deployment

If the deployment is no longer needed, delete it. This will also delete all nested resources within the group. There are several ways to delete the deployment. This is one way to do it.

1. Go to the Azure portal menu or the home page and select **Managed Applications**.
1. In the filter box, enter the deployment name.
1. Select the check box and select **Delete**.
1. Enter **yes** and select **Delete**.
